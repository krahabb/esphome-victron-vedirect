# This config snippet provides a minimal easy configuration to read only TEXT frames data.
# Depending on 'flavor' memory consumption could be optimized for the device we're interfacing.
# Actual entities will be automatically created when the first TEXT frame enters the node so there's
# no need to provide a definition for eache entity/value in this config file.

    flavor: [ALL]
    # flavor: [] optional
    # Provides presets for common entity types which can be automatically instantiated when the device
    # exposes them (see auto_create_entities). This option works as an optimization for memory usage
    # since you can fine-tune which group of entity types are compiled/linked into the node in order to
    # be automatically generated at runtime. You can add as many flavors as needed from the list of available
    # ones which is [ALL,INV_PHNX,CHG_PHNX,MPPT_BS,MPPT_RS,BMV60,BMV70,BMV71,MPPT,BMV,CHG,INV,ANY].
    # Flavor ALL means all the flavors are included (just a shortcut to avoid including each single item)
    # Flavor ANY relates to entity types which are usually present in every other flavor (this one too is
    # automatically included whenever a specific flavor is included/defined). Flavors work like an hierarchy
    # so that when you define MPPT_BS (Blue Solar MPPTs) the code automatically assumes
    # flavors MPPT - CHG - ANY are defined.
    # Setting flavor: [] in config.yaml will disable all the flavors so no pre-defined register grammar is
    # in place. This will save some statically allocated memory but also, if using 'auto_create_entities',
    # entities will be created as plain text sensors without any knowledge of their semantics.
    # Not setting 'flavor' in config.yaml will by default enable all flavors (like 'flavor: [ALL]')

      # the availability of the specific platform an entity will be generated and registered depending on
      # the data type carried by the TEXT frame record. The entities will be created as soon as a TEXT FRAME
      # enters the node.
