# This configuration snippet shows how to setup a basic 'diagnostic' node which is able to interface to any kind
# of VEDirect equipment and automatically create any entity for values which are automatically broadcasted by
# the device either via TEXT frames or via HEX frames.
# Some records (and hex registers) are being automatically normalized (see 'flavor') and created as proper
# numeric or binary sensors (or more specialized entities) depending on this knowledge
# (see 've_reg_text.h' 've_reg_register.h' for clues)

    flavor: [ALL]
    # flavor: [] optional
    # Provides presets for common entity types which can be automatically instantiated when the device
    # exposes them (see auto_create_entities). This option works as an optimization for memory usage
    # since you can fine-tune which group of entity types are compiled/linked into the node in order to
    # be automatically generated at runtime. You can add as many flavors as needed from the list of available
    # ones which is [ALL,INV_PHNX,CHG_PHNX,MPPT_BS,MPPT_RS,BMV60,BMV70,BMV71,MPPT,BMV,CHG,INV,ANY].
    # Flavor ALL means all the flavors are included (just a shortcut to avoid including each single item)
    # Flavor ANY relates to entity types which are usually present in every other flavor (this one too is
    # automatically included whenever a specific flavor is included/defined). Flavors work like an hierarchy
    # so that when you define MPPT_BS (Blue Solar MPPTs) the code automatically assumes
    # flavors MPPT - CHG - ANY are defined.
    # Setting flavor: [] in config.yaml will disable all the flavors so no pre-defined register grammar is
    # in place. This will save some statically allocated memory but also, if using 'auto_create_entities',
    # entities will be created as plain text sensors without any knowledge of their semantics.
    # Not setting 'flavor' in config.yaml will by default enable all flavors (like 'flavor: [ALL]')
    textframe:
      auto_create_entities: true
      # This will create an entity for each record carried in the TEXT FRAME. Depending on 'flavor' and
      # the availability of the specific platform an entity will be generated and registered depending on
      # the data type carried by the TEXT frame record. The entities will be created as soon as a TEXT FRAME
      # enters the node.
    hexframe:
      auto_create_entities: true
      # Same as 'textframe:auto_create_entities' but for entities/values carried over HEX frames.
      ping_timeout: 2min
      # HEX frames are usually not sent/broadcasted by the device unless it is 'forced' to do so by
      # explicitly querying an HEX register or issuing any HEX command. This option, if set, will
      # periodically query the device in HEX mode so that it keeps broadcasting HEX register values.
      # Depending on usage scenario (and esp node hw type) might be cumbersome for the esphome node
      # to keep managing all these data broadcasts.
      # Setting 'ping_timeout' to 0 will disable the feature and the device should not enter HEX mode
      # broadcast (Depending on VEDirect fw the device might enter HEX broadcast mode at boot but then
      # exit it (after a couple of minutes) as soon as no HEX commands/messages are received by the device)
